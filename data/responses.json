	"text": "Unless the male partner ejaculates some amount of semen, there is no possible chance of pregnancy. Semen contains sperm, the male reproductive cell and component of ejaculate that fertilizes the ovum (the female reproductive cell). Therefore, intimate acts, such as kissing, dry sex, fondling, and oral or manual stimulation, that do not result in ejaculation in the vagina typically warrant no risk of pregnancy. There would only be a risk if one of these acts ended with ejaculation into the vagina or onto the vulva. <p>If you still suspect you could be pregnant, we recommend you take a home pregnancy test or visit your doctor. It is common for stress to delay menstrual periods, so waiting to take a pregnancy test may cause additional unnecessary anxiety and the absence of your next anticipated period.</p>"

Your probability would increase if there was an ejaculation of semen inside or around your vagina at a time closer to your window of ovulation and if there was no attempt made to use contraception. <p>If you still suspect you could be pregnant, we recommend you take a home pregnancy test or visit your doctor.

	"title" : "Medium Risk of Pregnancy",
	"text": "Based on your responses to the questions regarding the ejaculation of semen in your sexual event, contraceptive use, and the regularity of your menstrual cycle, we typically would presume there to be a moderate risk of pregnancy following such events. This is because sperm, a component of the full ejaculation of semen, are fairly strong swimmers and can find their way into the vagina from surrounding locations or through thin or porous clothing material. Additionally, imperfect use of contraceptives (or only use of the “withdrawal” method) does not sufficiently protect a woman from becoming pregnant if she is within her window of ovulation. Having sex within the first few days of your menstrual cycle may also be risky because your decomposing uterine walls may still contain an ova. The last days of your menstrual period are less likely to warrant risk of pregnancy, as it becomes less likely the ova is still inside of your uterus; it is likely to have already bled out. <p>If you suspect that you could be pregnant, we always recommend you take an at-home pregnancy test as soon as possible. Finding out the results (either positive or negative) will allow you to evaluate your options if the results are not favorable to you and/or your partner, and time is of the essence if you want to have all of your options open. If you have taken an at-home pregnancy test and are still concerned about the results it is always a good idea to get them confirmed by a doctor.</p>"

	"title" : "High Risk of Pregnancy",
	"text": "Based on your responses to our questions regarding the ejaculation of semen in your sexual experience, your contraceptive use, and regularity of your menstrual cycle, we would typically consider there to be a high risk of pregnancy following your experience. This is because your “window of ovulation” typically occurs between 6 and 15 days of your last menstrual period, and if your menstrual period is irregular (or you are unsure of when the event occurred) it is difficult to asses when your fertile window might have been. During your window of ovulation you must take precautionary contraceptive measures in order to effectively avoid pregnancy, and if you used the withdrawal method, there is always a possibility of pre-ejaculate entering the vagina without either partner’s knowledge. If there was a problem with your contraceptive method for other reasons (i.e.- your condom broke, slipped off, etc.) there is an exponential increase in the likelihood of pregnancy if you were within your window of ovulation. <p>If you suspect that you could be pregnant, we always recommend you take an at-home pregnancy test as soon as possible. Finding out the results (either positive or negative) will allow you to evaluate your options if the results are not favorable to you and/or your partner, and time is of the essence if you want to have all of your options open.
